# Bakery-shop-management-system-using-Python-and-MySQL
The Bakery Shop Management System is a Python-MySQL based console application designed to manage the daily operations of a bakery. It includes two main modules: Admin and User.

The Admin can add, update, delete, and search products, as well as view customer feedback.

The User can browse products, place orders, and submit feedback.

All data is stored in a MySQL database, and product/order details are displayed in a neat tabular format using the PrettyTable module. This project uses object-oriented programming and demonstrates a simple way to integrate Python with MySQL for database operations.
